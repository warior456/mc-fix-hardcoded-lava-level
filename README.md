# mc-fix-hardcoded-lava-level
a fix for the hardcoded lava level that doesn't break normal lava gen like https://github.com/Andrew6rant/MC-237017-Fix

## caveats: 
this fix changes the hardcoded lava level from -54 to 117 blocks under sea level, this should fix a lot of custom dimensions but some extreme one might not be fixed with this
